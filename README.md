# NullControllability_MBSA_DroneReliability
This repository contains the essential codes and system architectures used in the research paper titled "Integrating Null Controllability and Model-Based Safety Assessment for Enhanced Reliability in Drone Design." The repository is divided into two main sections:

1. MATLAB Repository
This section includes MATLAB R2022b code for performing an ACAI-based controllability assessment of a selected UAV design. The key functionalities include:
- Controllability Assessment: The code evaluates the controllability of the chosen UAV design using the ACAI methodology.
- Integration with AltaRica 3.0: After the assessment, the code integrates the controllability results with a selected AltaRica 3.0 model, generating an updated AltaRica 3.0 model that includes the controllability assessment.

2. System Analyst Repository
This section contains the UAV system architecture models created in System Analyst 1.3, corresponding to the designs from iterations 1 to 6 for Scenario 1, and 1 to 5 for Scenario 2, as discussed in the paper. Each model illustrates the progression of design changes across the iterations.
